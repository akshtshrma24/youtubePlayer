# YoutubePlayer

Downloads youtube videos and makes it availble to play in playlist and
allows for easy controlling with next, previous, and stop buttons <br>
Also updates the playlists automatically every night to ensure the playlists added are
always up to date with the playlists on youtube. This is to make it so you download the playlist once, and never 
have to enter the url into the web server again.

Copy and Paste the following to install
```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/akshtshrma24/youtubePlayer.git 
    cd youtubePlayer 
    ./runPlayer.sh 
```

To Run the server again simply run `./runPlayer.sh`
